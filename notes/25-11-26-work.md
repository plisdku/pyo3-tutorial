# Learning PyO3

November 26, 2025

## Learned last time

 - Let's use `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv run`
   - the point of `uv run` is it always uses `.venv`
 - `uv run maturin init` will set up the rust + python project, but only if one hasn't been set up before
 - `uv run maturin develop` compiles the rust stuff and installs it in site-packages
 - you have to write your own `.pyi` files for now to get docstrings in your IDE for the rusty stuff.
   - the `__doc__` attribute is set by PyO3 or maturin or something, for the little that's worth
 - in Rust, Python objects are wrapped in smart pointers like `Py<T>`

# Rust modules

I never really got this figured out. I'm not a fan of this `lib.rs` thing, it's terribly confusing trying to open the right file in an IDE. Anyway, let's review the options.
