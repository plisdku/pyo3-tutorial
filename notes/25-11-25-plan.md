# Plan

I want to be done with this repo fairly soon, but let us set some learning goals.

## Lists

Let's compare the performance of `PyList` and conversion to a `Vec` somehow. One possible way is, I could implement a sorting algorithm both ways and do some kind of queries.

 - Implement bubblesort or something using `Vec`
 - Implement sort on `PyList`
 - Compare runtimes
 - Control this all nicely from the Python side

## Dicts

Also interested to compare `PyDict` to whatever the Rust map is. I forget what it's called.

 - Phone book demo class
   - Using `PyDict`
   - Using the built-in thing

On the Python side, this might implement

```
class Phonebook:
 def __init__(self, contents: dict[str, int]): ...
 def __getitem__(self, key: str) -> int: ...
 def __setitem__(self, key: str, value: int): ...
 def multi_query(self, keys: list[str]) -> list[int]: ...
```

I'll learn a lot from this silly thing.
